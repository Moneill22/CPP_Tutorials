Hello!

This repo serves as a record of simple C++ programs done while going through tutorials.

Beginning with learning very basic syntax, working with different data types, and working with input and output, and ending with solving classic DS&A problems.

The goal is to be competent enough in C++ to perform well using in it in a professional environment, as well as begin developing my project portfolio with various distributed systems projects.
